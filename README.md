1. Computing Community and History of Computing
2. Open-Source Software
3. ReadMe File Creation
4. Online Arduino Practical

**Monday 1/11/2021 Independent Study**

Different from in-Studio students, today my task is to learn ‚ÄòCreative Computing‚Äô by myself based on the materials given. The video gave me some insight into the history of computing, for example, the principle of computing, evolution, and function optimization according to increasing needs. Open-source Software is another new topic in this material. To put it simply, it provides a collaborative public space from which users can freely change their content. The game "Draw a House" gave me a better understanding of the concept of OSS from the sentence in instruction:
>"every player can copy/edit/delete what is on the whiteboard".

**Tuesday 2/11/2021 Independent Study & Tutorial with Maggie and GTA**

Continuing with yesterday's self-study materials, today I learned about README File and made an Arduino Practical. In the article "READ.ME File - Everything you Need to Know", it states that 
>a README File is "the first File which users READ", It helps the interviewer understand what the project for. 

I think the most helpful information here is how to write a good README file and how is README written. Because my final task is to produce a README according to my study of this week, it is crucial for me to build a good template and fill in the right content. Among them, markdown is a new knowledge point and term for me, which is also featured in README. 
>It is a ‚Äúlightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor‚Äù. 

Arduino is like a physics experiment in high school, making LED lights light up with resistors, wires and power supply. TinkerCAD has a step-by-step annotation, which gives me a deeper understanding of the whole experiment process. Unlike ordinary physics experiments, these operations are done by a series of codes. In the tutorial, I explained my working process of these two days and discussed my understanding of README File to ensure that I was in the right track.

**Thursday 4/11/2021**

I started to produce my README File. With the study of the first three days, I have a good understanding of the basic format. My README File will be related to my Learning Log and Guide for Future Remote Learners.

**Guide for Future Remote Learners**

After this week's study, I would like to give the following suggestions to remote learners who will take this section later: 
1. Manage your time. Compared with my "Time-base Thinking" section last week, the actual operation workload in Creating Computing will be much reduced, and more reading materials need to be learned consciously. 
2. Read the powerpoint given by Jazmin carefully, which contains effective information and it is helpful for the completion of the final task. 
3. When in doubt, try to contact the tutor and GTA. Creative Computing is a brand new and unknown field for me. This is my first time to learn relevant knowledge, and due to remote learning, I have many uncertain ideas about some knowledge points. Therefore, I communicated with my tutor and GTA this week to ensure my understanding is correct. 
4. Keep in touch with in-studio students. Because our curriculum arrangement is slightly different from that of in-studio students, keeping in touch with them in the curriculum can help us acquire more comprehensive knowledge and know each other's progress.
