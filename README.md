#learn **‘Creative Computing’** by myself based on the materials given 
##video - **history of computing**, 
>the principle of computing
>evolution
>function optimization according to increasing needs
###**Open-source Software** 
>another new topic 
> it provides a collaborative public space from which users can freely change their content. ["Draw a House" >> a better understanding of the concept of OSS **"every player can copy/edit/delete what is on the whiteboard"** in instruction.]

Tuesday 2/11/2021 Independent Study & Tutorial with Maggie and GTA_ _ 🙃
#learned **README File** 
##**Arduino Practical**
###**"READ.ME File - Everything you Need to Know"**, it states that a [README File is >> "the first File which users READ"], It helps the interviewer understand what the project for. I think the most helpful information here is how to write a good README file and how is README written. Because my final task is to produce a README according to my study of this week, it is crucial for me to build a good template and fill in the right content. Among them,**markdown** is a new knowledge point and term for me, which is also featured in README. [It is a “lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor”.] Arduino is like a physics experiment in high school, making LED lights light up with resistors, wires and power supply. TinkerCAD has a step-by-step annotation, which gives me a deeper understanding of the whole experiment process. Unlike ordinary physics experiments, these operations are done by a series of codes. In the tutorial, I explained my working process of these two days and discussed my understanding of README File to ensure that I was in the right track.

Thursday 4/11/2021 _ _ _ 😃
I started to produce my README File. With the study of the first three days, I have a good understanding of the basic format. My README File will be related to my Learning Log and Guide for Future Remote Learners.

*Guide for Future Remote Learners* 😎
>**Manage your time**. Compared with my "Time-base Thinking" section last week, the actual operation workload in Creating Computing will be much reduced, and more reading materials need to be learned consciously. 
>**Read the powerpoint given by Jazmin carefully**, which contains effective information and it is helpful for the completion of the final task. 
>When in doubt, try to **contact the tutor and GTA**. Creative Computing is a brand new and unknown field for me. This is my first time to learn relevant knowledge, and due to remote learning, I have many uncertain ideas about some knowledge points. Therefore, I communicated with my tutor and GTA this week to ensure my understanding is correct.
>**Keep in touch with in-studio students**. Because our curriculum arrangement is slightly different from that of in-studio students, keeping in touch with them in the curriculum can help us acquire more comprehensive knowledge and know each other's progress.
